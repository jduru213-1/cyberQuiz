    "DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service)": {
        "description": "A DDoS attack aims to overwhelm a network, service, or server with an excessive amount of traffic, rendering it inoperable.",
        "scenario": "Your company‚Äôs website is flooded with excessive traffic, causing it to crash. What should you do?",
        "choices": [
            "A) Increase server capacity to handle more traffic.",
            "B) Monitor the traffic sources and block malicious IP addresses.",
            "C) Shut down the website temporarily."
        ],
        "correct": 1,  # B is the correct answer
        "explanation": "The best response is to monitor the traffic and block malicious IP addresses. Increasing server capacity won‚Äôt stop the attack, and shutting down the website should be a last resort."
    },
    "Malware": {
        "description": "Malware is malicious software designed to disrupt, damage, or gain unauthorized access to a computer system.",
        "scenario": "Your colleague accidentally downloads a suspicious file, and now their computer is behaving strangely. What should you do?",
        "choices": [
            "A) Reboot the system.",
            "B) Run an antivirus scan and disconnect the system from the network.",

        "correct": 1,  # B is the correct answer
        "explanation": "Running an antivirus scan and disconnecting the system from the network can help isolate and remove the malware."
    },
    "Ransomware": {
        "description": "Ransomware encrypts your data and demands payment for its release.",
        "scenario": "Your company‚Äôs files are encrypted, and a ransom note demands payment in cryptocurrency to regain access. What should you do?",
        "choices": [
            "A) Pay the ransom to regain access to the files.",
            "B) Restore files from backup and inform authorities.",
            "C) Try to decrypt the files yourself."
        ],
        "correct": 1,  # B is the correct answer
        "explanation": "The best response is to restore files from backups if available and report the attack. Paying the ransom is risky as it does not guarantee file recovery."

        "description": "A Man-in-the-Middle attack involves an attacker intercepting communication between two parties without their knowledge.",
